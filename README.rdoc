== Intro
Launches 10 concurrent backgranundable tasks (aka simulators) that print out a message every 2 seconds
for five times


== Instructions
* Go to localhost:8080 to launch 10 simulators

== Notes
I  added in standalone-ha.xml HornetQ window size as here: https://gist.github.com/1576e497fe7c673b0fba

I start server like this: 
* $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-ha.xml

I deploy like this: 
*  jruby -S bundle exec rake assets:precompile (*note:* precompiled assets are committed)
* RAILS_ENV=production jruby -S bundle exec rake torquebox:deploy 

The first time I launch the simulators on a clean deploy, i.e:

* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/deployments/*
* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/tmp/*
* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/data/*

I get the expected behavior (see server.log). The second time I launch them, after the first 
ten have finished, (i.e. I go again on
localhost:8080), I get only two at the time. 
The behavior is deterministic.
