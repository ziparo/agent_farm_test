== Intro
Launches 10 concurrent backgranundable tasks (aka simulators) that print out a message every 2 seconds
for five times


== Instructions
* Go to localhost:3000 to launch 10 simulators

== Notes
* added in standalone-ha.xml HornetQ window size as here: https://gist.github.com/1576e497fe7c673b0fba
* I start server like this: $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-ha.xml
* I deploy like this: RAILS_ENV=production jruby -S bundle exec rake torquebox:deploy 

The first time I launch the simulators on a clean deploy, i.e:

* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/deployments/*
* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/tmp/*
* rm -rf ~/torquebox-current/jboss/standalone/data/*

I get the expected behavior (see server.log). The second time, I get only two at the time. 
The behavior is deterministic.
